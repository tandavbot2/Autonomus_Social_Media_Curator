To start posting on connected platforms, you'll need to run the main script that executes the social media bot. Here are the commands you should use:

## Basic Posting Command

```
python social_media_bot/main.py
```

This will run the automated posting process using all enabled platforms in your configuration.

## Check Which Platforms Are Enabled

To see which platforms are currently enabled and connected, you can use:

```
python social_media_bot/utils/platform_status.py
```

This will show you the status of all configured platforms (Reddit, Dev.to, Mastodon, and Threads).

## Post to Specific Platforms Only

If you want to post to specific platforms only:

```
python social_media_bot/post_tech_news.py --platforms reddit,devto
```

Replace "reddit,devto" with your preferred platforms (options: reddit, devto, mastodon, threads).

## Test a Single Post to a Platform

For testing a post to a specific platform:

```
python social_media_bot/test_reddit_post.py
```

Replace "reddit" with the platform you want to test (test_devto_post.py, etc.)

For the platforms to work, make sure you've:
1. Set up the appropriate API keys in your .env file
2. Installed the required dependencies (which you've done with the updated requirements.txt)
3. Confirmed your authentication is working correctly

Based on the codebase, the following platforms are implemented:
- Reddit (using PRAW)
- Dev.to
- Mastodon
- Threads (Instagram)

Your content quality framework will automatically be used when posting to ensure all content meets quality standards.



To post to platforms other than Reddit, use this command:

```
python -m social_media_bot.post_tech_news --platforms dev.to,mastodon
```

You can specify any combination of platforms:
- For a single platform: `--platforms dev.to`
- For multiple platforms: `--platforms reddit,dev.to,mastodon,threads`

The original functionality for posting to Reddit only is still preserved with:
```
python -m social_media_bot.post_tech_news --reddit
```

If you run without any flags, it will attempt to post to all available connected platforms.

   # Post to specific platforms with content enhancement
   python -m social_media_bot.multi_platform_post --platforms dev.to,mastodon
   
   # Post to all available platforms without enhancement
   python -m social_media_bot.multi_platform_post --no-enhance
