## Plan for Content Quality Framework

**1. Architecture Overview**
- Create a content quality verification module that integrates with your existing CrewAI system
- Add a "Content Transparency Framework" component that works alongside your existing agents
- Develop templates and rule sets for tech news posts

**2. Implementation Approach**
- Extend your existing content_tools.py with new functions for credibility and transparency
- Create configuration files for disclosure templates
- Add evaluation metrics for content quality before posting

**3. Technologies**
- No new paid APIs required - we'll use your existing DeepSeek API integration
- Build on top of your existing Python framework
- Leverage free APIs for factual cross-checking where possible

**4. Key Components**

### A. Content Credibility Evaluator
```python
class ContentCredibilityEvaluator:
    # Analyzes tech news content for credibility factors:
    # - Source attribution
    # - Factual consistency
    # - Verification status
    # - Experience level transparency
```

### B. Transparency Templates
- Set of pre-defined templates that:
  - Clearly indicate author's knowledge level on the topic
  - Provide appropriate disclaimers
  - Include proper attribution
  - Maintain professional tone

### C. Content Quality Rules Engine
- Rule-based system to evaluate posts against quality criteria:
  - Structure requirements
  - Fact-checking requirements
  - Source attribution requirements
  - Disclosure requirements

### D. Post Enhancement Module
- Tools to improve post quality:
  - Structure formatter
  - Source validator
  - Fact-checking prompts
  - Disclosure generator

**5. Integration with Existing Codebase**
- Connect to your existing content generation pipeline
- Hook into your safety validation process
- Extend your platform-specific formatters

**6. Implementation Steps**
1. Create the new module files
2. Integrate with your existing agents
3. Add configuration options
4. Create testing scenarios
5. Implement quality metrics

**7. Cost Considerations**
- No additional API costs beyond what you're already using with DeepSeek
- Minimal computational overhead
- Potential for reduced moderation needs due to improved quality

**8. Timeline**
- Framework design and initial implementation: 1-2 days
- Integration with existing system: 1 day
- Testing and refinement: 1 day

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this framework? I can create the necessary files and integrate them with your existing system based on the plan above.
